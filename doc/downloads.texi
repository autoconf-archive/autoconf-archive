The macros distributed by the Archive are maintained in a public Git repository
at @indicateurl{https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/autoconf-archive.git}. That repository can
be cloned anonymously, which is probably the most convenient way to access the
Archive. Gitweb offers an
@uref{http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=autoconf-archive.git;a=rss,RSS
feed} for subscription that informs about changes to the repository. The same
information is available via e-mail, too, on the
@uref{http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf-archive-commits,commits
mailing list}.

For the benefit of everyone who doesn't use Git, traditional release
archives can be downloaded from any GNU mirror, i.e.
@uref{http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/autoconf-archive/}. New release are
always announced on the low-traffic
@uref{http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf-archive-announce,announcements
mailing list}.
