CHAPTERS = introduction.texi downloads.texi contribute.texi fdl-1.3.texi
info_TEXINFOS = autoconf-archive.texi
EXTRA_DIST = $(TEXIFILES) $(CHAPTERS) all-macros.texi

## Just in case the manually-specified dependencies fail to cause these
## to get built:
autoconf_archive_TEXINFOS = all-macros.texi version.texi

autoconf-archive.info: autoconf-archive.texi all-macros.texi $(TEXIFILES) $(CHAPTERS) version.texi
##FIXME: this rule for rebuilding all-macros.texi is kind of a hack:
all-macros.texi: @MAINT@ $(top_srcdir)/cfg.mk
	@if test "x$(AM_DISTCHECK_DVI_TARGET)" != "x"; then \
	  test -n "$${AM_DISTCHECK_DVI_TARGET}" && echo "AM_DISTCHECK_DVI_TARGET is $${AM_DISTCHECK_DVI_TARGET}"; \
	fi; \
	$(am__cd) .. && make maintainer-all
