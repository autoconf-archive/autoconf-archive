* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

  The following macros have been added: AX_CXX_HELPFUL_TERMINATE_HANDLER.

  AX_C_IFDEF has been deprecated, because standard Autoconf contains a macro,
  AC_CHECK_DECL, which replaces its functionality.

  AX_CHECK_ICU has been extended to support icu-specific CPPFLAGS.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.12.16 (2009-12-16) [alpha]

  All macros that used a prefix other than AX_ -- or no prefix at all -- have
  been renamed to use AX_ consistently. The new version forward old calls under
  their old names to the new ones via Autoconf's AU_ALIAS mechanism.

  The HTML documentation is obsolete. Instead, the archive now ships its
  documentation in Texinfo format.

  All macros distributed by the archive are now licensed under terms that do
  *not* limit the choice of license for the generated configure script.
  Previous releases didn't meet this requirement because they contained macros
  that were licensed under GPL or Lesser GPL without an Autoconf Exception.

  Please refer to the [[ChangeLog]] file for a complete list of changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.07.31 (2009-07-31) [alpha]

  The archive has moved to Savannah: http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/
  Version 2009-04-26 was the last to be released at autoconf-archive.cryp.to.

  The version identifier has been changed to a "year.month.day" spelling,
  rather than the ISO format, because the dot-separated spelling works better
  for most distributions and for the gnulib infrastructure.

  The 2009.07.31 release was an internal test release that has never been
  publicly available.
