* Noteworthy changes in release 2018.03.13 (2018-03-13) [stable]

  The macros AX_R_PACKAGE and AX_PROG_DATE have been added. Many other macros
  have received updates.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2017.09.28 (2017-09-28) [stable]

  The macros AX_PROG_HELP2MAN, AX_RECURSIVE_EVAL, AX_SUBDIRS_CONFIGURE,
  AX_ELISP, and AX_PROG_EMACS have been added.

  Various macros have received updates. Please check the ChangeLog file or the
  history of the git repository for further details.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2017.03.21 (2017-03-21) [stable]

  Obsolete macros AX_CXX_COMPILER_VENDOR, AX_GCC_LIBRARIES_DIR, AX_GCC_VERSION,
  and AX_HAVE_OPENGL have been removed from the archive.

  AX_DEFINE_SUB_PATH has been marked obsolete as suggested in
  https://github.com/peti/autoconf-archive/pull/97.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2016.09.16 (2016-09-16) [stable]

  The following macros were added: AX_BUILD_DATE_EPOCH, AX_CHECK_X86_FEATURES,
  AX_GCC_X86_CPU_SUPPORTS, AX_OPEN62541_CHECK_H, AX_OPEN62541_CHECK_LIB, and
  AX_LUAROCKS_ROCK.

  While updating AX_CODE_COVERAGE, the variable CODE_COVERAGE_LDFLAGS was
  renamed to CODE_COVERAGE_LIBS.

  AX_VALGRIND_CHECK has been extended considerably. In this process. the
  undocumented internal rule check-valgrind-tool was removed.

  It checks if the host cpu supports various instruction set: mmx, sse, popcnt,
  avx, avx2, etc. If the instruction were supported, it would export
  HAVE_XXX_INSTRUCTIONS C preprocessor macros and add the instruction set flag to
  X86_FEATURES_CFLAGS variable. By default it would also set CFLAGS, but this can
  be disabled by the ACTION-IF-FOUND hook.

  AX_WITH_CURSES and AX_WITH_CURSES_* macros have been modernized, in line
  with PKG_CHECK_MODULES's style. This change breaks the interface, but
  makes AX_WITH_CURSES compatible and even completely replaceable with the
  interface of PKG_CHECK_MODULES. Ultimately, these macros should be
  replaced in the future by calls to PKG_CHECK_MODULES. Variables in
  AX_WITH_CURSES have been renamed

    CURSES_LIB -> CURSES_LIBS
    CURSES_CPPFLAGS -> CURSES_CFLAGS

  and for the AX_WITH_CURSES_* macros

    PANEL_LIB -> PANEL_LIBS
    MENU_LIB -> MENU_LIBS
    FORM_LIB -> FORM_LIBS

  such that once the variables have been renamed in configure.ac and Makefile.am,
  the calls AX_WITH_CURSES and PKG_CHECK_MODULES([CURSES], [ncurses]) are
  completely interchangeable.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2016.03.20 (2016-03-20) [stable]

  The following new macros have been added: AX_CHECK_GIRS_GJS,
  AX_CHECK_GIR_SYMBOLS_GJS, AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX, AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_14,
  AX_CZMQ, AX_FC_CHECK_DEFINE, AX_LIB_NETCDF4, AX_PROG_GJS,
  AX_RESTORE_FLAGS_WITH_PREFIX, AX_SAVE_FLAGS_WITH_PREFIX, AX_VAR_POP,
  AX_VAR_PUSH, and AX_ZMQ.

  Various improvements to the opengl macros. Main features added:
    - Support action-if-found and not-found hook
    - Export HAVE_GL, HAVE_GLU, and HAVE_GLUT preprocessor symbol
    - Add necessary flags to CFLAGS/LIBS by default, but can be disabled by
      overwriting action-if-found hook.
    - Fail the configure script if lib not found. This feature can be disabled
      by overwriting action-if-not-found hook
    - Fix problems on Mac OSX. Been tested on Linux (Ubuntu) and OSX
    - Use --with-xquartz-gl instead of --with-gl=x for using X11 on OSX

  Many new features were added to AX_CODE_COVERAGE and AX_PROG_DOXYGEN.

  AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX now modifies $(CXX) rather than $(CXXFLAGS).

  AX_PTHREAD has been updated significantly. See
  https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?8186 for further details.

  AX_PYTHON_DEVEL now provides PYTHON_LIBS instead of PYTHON_FLAGS.

  The macros related to C++11 and C++14 were extensively re-factored.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2015.09.25 (2015-09-25) [stable]

  The Archive no longer releases an "lzip"-compressed tarball. The only
  supported format now is "xz". The rationale is that xz so widely supported
  that it seems pointless to archive two release archives on our servers for no
  apparent reason.

  AX_PYTHON_DEVEL changed to provide PYTHON_LIBS, not PYTHON_LDFLAGS. This
  change breaks scripts written with previous versions in mind! The rationale
  is that -L and -l are LIBS arguments, not LDFLAGS arguments. Returning output
  in PYTHON_LDFLAGS suggested wrongly that they should be used in LDFLAGS,
  which can cause the -L and -l arguments to be ignored when they are not in
  the expected position in the list of command line arguments. This is a
  problem, for instance, with the command line generated by AC_LINK_IFELSE.

  AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11 now supports Cray's crayCC compiler (CCE 8.4).

  AX_PYTHON, AX_PYTHON_EMBED now support Python 3.4.

  test-suites, Makefiles in different locations and many more features.

  AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11 now checks for attribute support with C++11 macro.
  Some compilers pass the other tests while not implementing this part of the
  C++11 specification. The test used also does not cause warnings with GCC or
  Clang, and can be used with -Werror.

  The new macro AX_PROG_BISON_VERSION can be used to check for specific
  versions of bison.

  The new macro AX_PROG_FLEX_VERSION can be used to check for specific
  versions of flex.

  AX_APPEND_FLAG no longer fails if the given flag contains a ','.

  AX_LUA now supports Lua 5.3.

  AX_BERKELEY_DB_CXX now supports FreeBSD.

  AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11 now support HP aCC.

  AX_PYTHON_MODULE and AX_PYTHON_MODULE_VERSION now support Python 3.

  The new macro AX_PYTHON_MODULE_VERSION has been added.

  AX_LIB_POSTGRESQL provides a new output variable POSTGRESQL_LIBS.

  AX_PATH_GENERIC now supports flags that contain spaces.

  AX_BOOST_BASE now supports native Windows header only libraries.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2015.02.24 (2015-02-24) [stable]

  AX_CHECK_ENABLE_DEBUG now uses $ax_is_release as default for IS-RELEASE.

  AX_IS_RELEASE now supports micro-version policies.

  Portability of AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_0X has been improved.

  AX_PROG_HAXE_VERSION is a new macro to detect the presence of Haxe
  <http://haxe.org>.

  AX_COMPILER_FLAGS has undergone extensive re-factoring.

  AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CXXFLAGS is a new macro that tests available C++ compiler
  warnings.

  AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11 can now test for SFINAE with template aliases.

  AX_APPEND_FLAG: Fix a regression introduced in the previous release.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2015.02.04 (2015-02-04) [stable]

  AX_OPENMP: Test that we can actually #include <omp.h> successfully.

  AX_COMPILER_FLAGS was re-factored into AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CFLAGS and
  AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_LDFLAGS.

  AX_CODE_COVERAGE detects gcov program.

  AX_VALGRIND_CHECK now supports running without libtool.

  AX_GCC_VERSION was improved.

  Re-factored and modernized the macros AX_CXX_TEMPLATES, AX_CXX_CONST_CAST,
  AX_CXX_COMPLEX_MATH_IN_NAMESPACE_STD, AX_CXX_BOOL, AX_APPEND_FLAG,
  AX_CHECK_*_FLAG, AX_CHECK_ENABLE_DEBUG, and
  AX_CXX_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_PARAMETERS.

  AX_CXX_COMPILER_VENDOR was deprecated in favor of AX_COMPILER_VENDOR.

  AX_HAVE_OPENGL was deprecated in favor of AX_CHECK_GL, AX_CHECK_GLU,
  AX_CHECK_GLUT, and AX_CHECK_GLX.

  AX_CHECK_GL has a new parameter --with-mesa that allows choosing the order of
  opengl lib detection.

  Portability of AX_LUA was improved. Support for LUA 5.0 was added.

  New macros AX_IS_RELEASE, AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_GIR, AX_CXX_ERASE_ITERATOR_TYPE,
  AX_COMPILER_VERSION, AX_CHECK_GLX, AX_CHECK_VSCRIPT, AX_VALGRIND_CHECK,
  AX_PKG_CHECK_MODULES, and AX_COMPILER_FLAGS were added.

  AX_PROG_FLEX: Also accept gflex.

  AX_LIB_HDF5: remove extra leading space from include path flag. That space
  creeps into HDF5_CPPFLAGS and breaks the include path flag into two tokens,
  e.g., "-I" and "/usr/include". While this may be legal and doesn't affect the
  compilation, it does break some library tools (e.g., when the macro is used
  in building a dynamic library that uses pkg-config).

  AX_PERL_MODULE_VERSION: use more portable syntax for shell arithmetic.

  AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR: support standard Oracle JDK installation layout on Mac OS
  X.

  AX_PROG_JAVAH_BIN_DIR: fix misspelled variable name and follow javah symlink
  to find jni.h.

  AX_BOOST_PYTHON: use unique names for local variables

* Noteworthy changes in release 2014.10.15 (2014-10-15) [stable]

  A brand-new Github mirror of the Archive's Git repository is available at
  <https://github.com/peti/autoconf-archive>. That project allows developers to
  submit patches as Pull Requests instead of having to go through Savannah's
  patch tracker.

  The Archive no longer creates release tarballs compressed with gzip and
  bzip2; only tarballs compressed with xz and lzip are distributed.

  AX_LIB_POSTGRESQL: substitute CPPFLAGS rather than CFLAGS.

  AX_GCC_ARCHFLAG: Rewrite x86 support <https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?8514>
  and extend Clang support <https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/index.php?8515>.

  AX_BOOST_PYTHON: several issue have been fixed. Further details can be found
  at <https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/index.php?8540>.

  AX_HAVE_QT: Only check $PATH and qmake for Qt variables. The old logic for
  detecting Qt without $PATH or qmake was never very reliable and the last
  change to this macro broke it entirely. If the Qt variables cannot be found
  via $PATH and qmake, then it would be best to manually define them in the
  makefile.

  AX_TLS: fix quoting problem.

  AX_F90_LIBRARY: several bug fixes and improvements. Further details are at
  <https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?8500>.

  stdout and stderr are awk regular expressions. Further details can be found
  at <https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?8492>.

  AX_OPENMP: prevent false negative due to -Wunused-variable.

  AX_COMPILER_VENDOR: improve detection of the CRAY compiler.

   - The macro interface has been extend to the typical ([action-if-found],
     [action-if-not-found])-style.

   - Previous versions used to search zlib in "usual locations" only if
     --with-zlib was provided [by user]. Now, the macro performs that search in
     default mode, too.

  the flag -Wobsolete. Furthermore, the standard utility autoupdate(1) provides
  assistance with updating existing "configure.ac" files.

  AX_PROG_DOXYGEN has been extended to implement "DX_DOT_FEATURE(ON|OFF)". This
  feature was documented, but it didn't actually exist. Further details are
  available at <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7340>.

  A bug in AX_BOOST_BASE has been fixed that would cause BOOST_LDFLAGS to be
  detected incorrectly. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7337> for further
  details.

  AX_LIB_HDF5 has been extended to support requesting either a serial or a
  parallel HDF5 installation. Furthermore, the macro can now detect whether or
  not a Fortran-ready installation is present. Further details are available at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7338>.

  AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL has been cleaned up to avoid use of obsolete Autoconf
  constructs. Also, a new variant of the macro, AX_FCFLAGS_WARN_ALL, has been

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.06.04 (2010-06-04) [beta]

  The Autoconf Archive has been declared an official GNU project. Consequently,
  the web site has moved from <http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/> to
  <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/>. Old addresses remain valid
  for the foreseeable future, though.

  AX_BOOST_DATE_TIME and AX_BOOST_FILESYSTEM have been patched to function
  correctly on systems that use "dash" as the system shell (i.e. Debian).

  function AX_PYTHON_INSIST being undefined.

  The new AX_LIB_HDF5 macro provides functionality to detect the HDF5 library.

  The version detection code in AX_PKG_SWIG has been fixed. Previous versions
  of this macro would fail to accept SWIG 2.0 where SWIG >= 1.3.x was requested.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.02.14 (2010-02-14) [beta]

  All macros have been assigned a unique serial number that corresponds to the
  number of commits that have modified the macro in the Archive's Git
  repository. Refer to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool//manual/automake/Serials.html][Automake documentation on serial numbers]] for further
  details about why these numbers are useful.

  The text of the all-permissive license has been augmented by an express
  warranty disclaimer as [[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html][suggested by the Free Software Foundation]].

  AX_CXX_VERBOSE_TERMINATE_HANDLER has been generalized to support
  architectures other than GNU libstdc++.

  AX_CHECK_ICU has been extended to support icu-specific CPPFLAGS.

  environment and extended to support an
  ACTION-IF-FOUND/ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND-style API.

  AX_PTHREAD has been updated to succeed when compiling with -Wall and -Werror.

  AX_C_IFDEF has been deprecated, because the standard Autoconf macro
  AC_CHECK_DECL provides the same functionality.

  AX_C_PRINTF_THSEP has been deprecated because of technical flaws. See
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6848 for further details.

  AX_RESTORE_FLAGS and AX_SAVE_FLAGS have been added.

  AX_SYS_LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE has improved support for x86_64 hosts.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.12.16 (2009-12-16) [alpha]

  All macros that used a prefix other than AX_ -- or no prefix at all -- have
  been renamed to use AX_ consistently. The new version forward old calls under
  their old names to the new ones via Autoconf's AU_ALIAS mechanism.

  The HTML documentation is obsolete. Instead, the archive now ships its
  documentation in Texinfo format.

  All macros distributed by the archive are now licensed under terms that do
  *not* limit the choice of license for the generated configure script.
  Previous releases didn't meet this requirement because they contained macros
  that were licensed under GPL or Lesser GPL without an Autoconf Exception.

  Please refer to the [[ChangeLog]] file for a complete list of changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.07.31 (2009-07-31) [alpha]

  The archive has moved to Savannah: http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/
  Version 2009-04-26 was the last to be released at autoconf-archive.cryp.to.

  The version identifier has been changed to a "year.month.day" spelling,
  rather than the ISO format, because the dot-separated spelling works better
  for most distributions and for the gnulib infrastructure.

  The 2009.07.31 release was an internal test release that has never been
  publicly available.
