# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_COMPILER_FLAGS([CFLAGS-VARIABLE], [LDFLAGS-VARIABLE], [IS-RELEASE], [EXTRA-BASE-CFLAGS], [EXTRA-MINIMUM-CFLAGS], [EXTRA-YES-CFLAGS], [EXTRA-MAXIMUM-CFLAGS], [EXTRA-ERROR-CFLAGS], [EXTRA-BASE-LDFLAGS], [EXTRA-MINIMUM-LDFLAGS], [EXTRA-YES-LDFLAGS], [EXTRA-MAXIMUM-LDFLAGS], [EXTRA-ERROR-LDFLAGS])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Check for the presence of an --enable-compile-warnings option to
#   configure, defaulting to "error" in normal operation, or "yes" if
#   IS-RELEASE is equal to "yes".  Return the value in the variable
#   $ax_enable_compile_warnings.
#
#   Depending on the value of --enable-compile-warnings, different compiler
#   warnings are checked to see if they work with the current compiler and,
#   if so, are appended to CFLAGS-VARIABLE and LDFLAGS-VARIABLE.  This
#   allows a consistent set of baseline compiler warnings to be used across
#   a code base, irrespective of any warnings enabled locally by individual
#   developers.  By standardising the warnings used by all developers of a
#   project, the project can commit to a zero-warnings policy, using -Werror
#   to prevent compilation if new warnings are introduced.  This makes
#   catching bugs which are flagged by warnings a lot easier.
#
#   By providing a consistent --enable-compile-warnings argument across all
#   projects using this macro, continuous integration systems can easily be
#   configured the same for all projects.
#
#   --enable-compile-warnings can take the values:
#
#    * no:      Base compiler warnings only; not even -Wall.
#    * minimum: The above, plus minimal extra warnings such as -Wall.
#    * yes:     The above, plus a broad range of useful warnings.
#    * maximum: The above, plus additional warnings which enforce a particular
#               coding style
#    * error:   The above, plus -Werror so that all warnings are fatal.
#
#   The set of flags enabled at each level can be augmented using the
#   EXTRA-*-CFLAGS and EXTRA-*-LDFLAGS variables.  Flags should not be
#   disabled using these arguments, as the entire point of AX_COMPILER_FLAGS
#   is to enforce a consistent set of useful compiler warnings on code,
#   using warnings which have been chosen for low false positive rates.  If a
#   compiler emits false positives for a warning, a #pragma should be used in
#   the code to disable the warning locally. See:
#
#       https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.2/gcc/Diagnostic-Pragmas.html#Diagnostic-Pragmas
#
#   IS-RELEASE can be used to disable -Werror when making a release, which
#   is useful for those hairy moments when you just want to get the release
#   done as quickly as possible.  Set it to "yes" to disable -Werror.
#
#   CFLAGS-VARIABLE defaults to WARN_CFLAGS, and LDFLAGS-VARIABLE defaults
#   to WARN_LDFLAGS.  Both variables are AC_SUBST-ed by this macro, but must
#   be manually added to the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables for each target in
#   the code base.
#
#   AX_COMPILER_FLAGS may add support for other tools in future, in addition to
#   the compiler and linker.  No extra EXTRA-* variables will be added for
#   those tools, and all extra support will still use the single
#   --enable-compile-warnings configure option.  For finer grained control over
#   the flags for individual tools, use AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CFLAGS,
#   AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_LDFLAGS and AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_* for new tools.
