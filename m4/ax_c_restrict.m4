# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_C_RESTRICT
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro checks if the C99 restrict keyword is broken with the current
#   compiler and optimizations settings. If broken, it undefines restrict to
#   do no harm. As of 2019 gcc since 5.0 and clang since 6.0 (June 2017) are
#   known to be broken and not yet fixed. See
#   https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878 with the links to the gcc
#   and clang tickets.
